# pix2grasshopper

## _Made for the course **DESIGN 6297 â€“ Coding for Design I**._

## Overview

This application allows designers to transform images and hand sketches into Python code compatible with Grasshopper's GHPython components, enabling the creation of corresponding geometries in Rhino. Using the power of PyTorch, OpenAI's CLIP, and ChatGPT API, the tool interprets visual patterns and structure and converts them into code that can be directly used within the Rhino environment.
